There are two parts in this project:

1. Server side (in the "api" folder)
2. Client side (in the "client" folder)


In each folder run the "npm i" command to install all the dependencies.

To run the app(s) locally:

1. In the "api" folder run the "npm run start" command. This will start the app on localhost:5000
2. In the "client" folder run the "npm run start" command. This will start the app on localhost:3000

The app should be ready to use at this point.
