There are two parts in this project:

1. Server side (in the "api" folder)
2. Client side (in the "client" folder)


In each folder run the "npm i" command to install all the dependencies.

To run the app(s) locally:

1. In the "api" folder run the "npm run start" command. This will start the API part on http://localhost:5000
2. In the "client" folder run the "npm run start" command. This will start the client part on http://localhost:3000

The app should be ready to use at this point.
Open http://localhost:3000 in the browser to use it.

* You can also run these app parts via Docker by running "docker-compose up" in current folder (where this README file is, outside "api" and "client" folders)

There's also an up and runnig app at https://dnb.birenbergg.com
