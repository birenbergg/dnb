There are two parts inthis project:

1. Server side (in api folder)
2. Client side (in api folder)


In each folder run the "npm i" command to install all the dependencies.

To run the app(s) locally:

1. In the "api" folder run the "npm run start" command. This will start the app on localhost:5000
2. In the "client" folder run the "npm run start" command. This will start the app on localhost:3000

The app should be ready to use at this point.
